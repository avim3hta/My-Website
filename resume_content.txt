Education
Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, IN
B.Tech. in Computer Science (Cyber Security).
Modern School, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi

Sept 2022 – May 2026
Year of completion: 2022

Secondary XII, Science - CBSE

Experience
December 2024 - Jan 2025
Info-Sec Team, Intern, Axis Securities - Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra
Info-Sec intern at Axis Securities performing Web Application Penetration testing using BurpSuite. Conducting
penetration testing focusing on OWASP Top 10 API vulnerabilities to identify and report security weaknesses.
Performed SSRF, CSRF, SQL Injection and API testing along side Vulnerablity Mitigation for each of them.
Embedded Systems Team, Intern, 3rdiTech - IIT Delhi, New Delhi
May 2024 – July 2024
• Performed research and analysis of interpolation algorithms for digital zoom, based on performance qualitatively
(image quality, artifact reduction) and quantitatively (processing speed, memory usage).
• Implemented a custom tuned lanczos2/bilinear algorithm on live video using C++ optimized for FPGA porting
• Optimized the original algorithm to achieve a 98.80% reduction in execution time of the loop, improving performance
factor around 83x (8.3 seconds -> 100 ms).
Embedded Systems Team, Intern, 3rdiTech - IIT Delhi, New Delhi
June 2023 – July 2023
As part of embedded systems team, I researched, designed and tested relevant algorithms:
• Lightweight live video stabilization using EIS(Electronic Image Stabilization)
• Kalman filtering on accelerometer/gyroscope data extracted from hardware IMU(MPU-6050)
• Designed an Algorithm to estimate distance on a camera with constraints (Monocular Depth Estimation)

Projects
avim3hta/NIDS
Network IPS Development
• Customizing Snort (NIDS) and integrating it with firewall capabilities and applying port mirroring. This integration
transforms Snort from a pure IDS into a hybrid Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that can both detect and respond to
threats in real-time
• Tools Used: Python, Snort, Wireshark
Object Detection Model - Yolov7
/lecturescribe
• Trained an object detection model using a custom data set and attained mAP@0.5 of >0.9 achived with
hyperparameter tuning [learning rate, batch size, model architecture, warmup epochs and data augmentation]
• Tools Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupiter Notebook, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pytorch
Lecture Scribe
avim3hta/imageinterpo
• Applies pre-processing techniques and extracts text written on the board. Implements segmentation which boosts
handwritten text recognition by 50%. Generates a speech transcript using Google Speech Recognition that has a
general accuracy of over 85%. Combines OCR text and speech transcript using Google’s Gemini model to generate
PDF notes.
• Tools Used: Python, OpenCV, PaddleOCR, Google Speech Recognition, Google Gemini API, mT5, NLP techniques
