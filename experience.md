# Experience

## Info-Sec Team, Intern
**Axis Securities - Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra**  
**December 2024 - January 2025**

- Info-Sec intern performing Web Application Penetration testing using BurpSuite
- Conducting penetration testing focusing on OWASP Top 10 API vulnerabilities to identify and report security weaknesses
- Performed SSRF, CSRF, SQL Injection and API testing alongside Vulnerability Mitigation for each of them

## Embedded Systems Team, Intern
**3rdiTech - IIT Delhi, New Delhi**  
**May 2024 – July 2024**

- Performed research and analysis of interpolation algorithms for digital zoom, based on performance qualitatively (image quality, artifact reduction) and quantitatively (processing speed, memory usage)
- Implemented a custom tuned lanczos2/bilinear algorithm on live video using C++ optimized for FPGA porting
- Optimized the original algorithm to achieve a 98.80% reduction in execution time of the loop, improving performance factor around 83x (8.3 seconds -> 100 ms)

## Embedded Systems Team, Intern
**3rdiTech - IIT Delhi, New Delhi**  
**June 2023 – July 2023**

- Researched, designed and tested relevant algorithms as part of embedded systems team
- Implemented lightweight live video stabilization using EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization)
- Developed Kalman filtering on accelerometer/gyroscope data extracted from hardware IMU (MPU-6050)
- Designed an algorithm to estimate distance on a camera with constraints (Monocular Depth Estimation)
