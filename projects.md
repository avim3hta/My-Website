# Projects

## Network IPS Development
**GitHub: avim3hta/NIDS**

- Customizing Snort (NIDS) and integrating it with firewall capabilities and applying port mirroring
- This integration transforms Snort from a pure IDS into a hybrid Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that can both detect and respond to threats in real-time
- Tools Used: Python, Snort, Wireshark

## Object Detection Model - Yolov7
**GitHub: /lecturescribe**

- Trained an object detection model using a custom data set and attained mAP@0.5 of >0.9
- Achieved high accuracy with hyperparameter tuning [learning rate, batch size, model architecture, warmup epochs and data augmentation]
- Tools Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupiter Notebook, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pytorch

## Lecture Scribe
**GitHub: avim3hta/imageinterpo**

- Applies pre-processing techniques and extracts text written on the board
- Implements segmentation which boosts handwritten text recognition by 50%
- Generates a speech transcript using Google Speech Recognition that has a general accuracy of over 85%
- Combines OCR text and speech transcript using Google's Gemini model to generate PDF notes
- Tools Used: Python, OpenCV, PaddleOCR, Google Speech Recognition, Google Gemini API, mT5, NLP techniques
